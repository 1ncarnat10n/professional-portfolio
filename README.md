# Professional Portfolio Challenge

## Description 

Creating a web portfolio is meant to showcase my skills on what I have learned with HTML and CSS, as well as showcase my projects, and accomplishments in a visually appealing and easily accessible format. It would help establish a professional online presence that would enable sharing work with a wider audience, including potential employers and collaborators. By creating a well-designed portfolio, it would hopefully help me stand out in competitive fields such as web development, design, or any creative profession.

Through this project, I learned about effective HTML and CSS structuring for building visually engaging and responsive websites, and the significance of user experience, so that the portfolio is accessible across various devices.
